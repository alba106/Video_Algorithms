# Independent study on video compression and visualization

Video compression algorithms for scientific data.

# Overview

This project explores video compression and visualization through a simple Python-based video player.
The goal is to build a lightweight tool that allows frame-by-frame navigation and zooming—features that are especially useful for studying video data in scientific and artistic contexts.
Later on, this work will expand into exploring how different video compression algorithms perform and how lossless video editing can be done for scientific use.

# Objectives

Create a video player that can:

- Move frame-by-frame

- Zoom into video frames

- (Future goal) Add the ability to label I, P, and B frames
