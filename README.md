# Video_Algorithms
# Independent study on video compression and visualization

Video compression algorithms for scientific data.

# Overview

This project explores video compression and visualization through a simple Python-based video player.
The goal is to build a lightweight tool that allows frame-by-frame navigation and zoomingâ€”features that are especially useful for studying video data in scientific and artistic contexts.

# Objectives

Create a video player that can:

- Move frame-by-frame

- Zoom into video frames

- (Future goal) Add the ability to label I, P, and B frames
